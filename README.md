PolyParkTrack is an idea that I have with the intention to solve the parking jam in Cal Poly. I always heard my friends and roommates complaining about spending too much time in the morning finding a available parking spot. PolyParkTrack is able to solve this problem by keeping track of parking spots that are available for students and allow students in Cal Poly to know exactly where the nearest parking spot is available to them in real time. The first step to make PolyParkTrack happen is to create an prototype of how it should be behave. 

As mentioned above, this is the working prorotype of how PolyParkTrack should be behave. The user is able to select starting location and click on "find the spot" button, then a bunch of text will be shown to the screen about where the parking spot is location.
